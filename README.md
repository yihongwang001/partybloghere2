### Party Page place
This website was create by Liudas Panavas and Yihong Wang for CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern (https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2020/)

### Objective
The objective of this website was to create an express and Mongodb and backend with a React front end. The Backend handles the different users and party locations and the React front end makes the webpage dynamic. We noticed that it is difficult to find a party venue location for various types of people on google maps. This website allows you to find a place in your area and browse exlusively party venues. Also different users can comment on the website and say if they liked it.
